In many industries, statistical process monitoring techniques play a key role in improving processes through variation reduction and defect prevention. 
Modern large-scale industrial processes require appropriate monitoring techniques that can efficiently address high-dimensional nonlinear processes. 
Such processes have been successfully monitored with several latent variable-based methods. 
However, because these monitoring methods use Hotellingâ€™s *T<sup>2</sup>* statistics in the reduced space, a normality assumption underlies the construction of these tools. 
This assumption has limited the use of latent variable-based monitoring charts in both nonlinear and nonnormal situations. 
In this study, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) as a monitoring method that can address both nonlinear and nonnormal situations in high-dimensional processes. 
VAE is appropriate for *T<sup>2</sup>* charts because it causes the reduced space to follow a multivariate normal distribution. 
The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed VAE-based chart were demonstrated through experiments on simulated data and real data from a thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display process.
