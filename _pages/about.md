Hello! I am Mingu Kwak, a postdoctoral fellow in the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Professor Jing Li. My research primarily focuses on developing artificial intelligence (AI) models for out-of-distribution or limited labeled data.
The application domains mainly include multichannel sensors, images, manufacturing processes, and medical data.
I am currently focusing on applications for medical image data.
