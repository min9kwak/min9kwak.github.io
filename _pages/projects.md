## Research Projects (Georgia Institute of Technology)
1. Image-based Models of Tumor-Immune Dynamics in Glioblastoma
   - 2023.10 ~ Present
   - Developed conditional diffusion & transformer models for translating tumorous brain images into healthy brain images for reducing patient heterogeneity.
   - Trained the model on benchmark datasets and applied it to internal datasets.
   - Utilized generated normal and original images to construct an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) classification model.

2. AIDen: An AI-Empowered Detection and Diagnosis System for Jaw Lesions Using CBCT
   - 2022.08 ~ Present
   - Integrated domain knowledge into a deep semantic segmentation model for precise lesion detection in 3D CBCT images.
   - Applied knowledge of lesion occurrence near tooth roots to regularize and guide the segmentation model.
   - Significantly improved the detection and segmentation performance of small lesions.

3. Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD
   - 2022.04 ~ Present
   - Developed a self-supervised contrastive model for classifying MCI converters and non-converters using 3D amyloid-PET images, incorporating label information during the pre-training step.
   - Created a mutual knowledge distillation model for handling incomplete multi-modal 3D image data (MRI and amyloid-PET) in MCI conversion classification.
   - Designed a novel teacher model that enhances knowledge distillation by focusing on modality-common representation.
