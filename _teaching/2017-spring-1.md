In the spring semester of 2017, I had the privilege of serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Quality Control course at Korea University, under the esteemed guidance of Professor Seoung Bum Kim. 
My responsibilities extended beyond the traditional TA roles of grading and holding office hours; 
I was also deeply involved in the creation and delivery of practical materials and lectures.

This course delved into various theoretical models of statistical quality control, requiring students to apply these models to real-world data to verify their efficacy. 
Previous lectures utilized Minitab for practical exercises, which, while user-friendly, posed limitations for the comprehensive analysis needed in term projects. 
To address this, I developed instructional materials and practical examples using the R programming language, which is more robust for statistical analysis.

I led lab sessions and coding assignments, ensuring students were well-versed in both the theoretical aspects of quality control and the practical application using R. 
This dual focus not only enhanced the students' learning experience but also prepared them better for future projects and professional challenges.

This experience significantly sharpened my technical skills and deepened my understanding of both quality control and programming.
Additionally, the opportunity to mentor and assist a diverse group of students enriched my communication skills and my ability to convey complex concepts in an accessible manner.
Through this role, I developed a keen ability to present intricate information clearly and effectively, ensuring comprehensive understanding among students.
